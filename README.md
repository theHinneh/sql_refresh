# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project involves working with SQL databases to retrieve and manipulate data from various tables. The primary focus
is on querying data from the `cd` schema, which includes tables such as `facilities`, `members`, and `bookings`.

## Files

### `basic.sql`

This file contains basic SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data from the `cd` schema.

### `joins_and_subqueries.sql`

This file contains SQL queries that involve joining multiple tables to retrieve complex data sets.

### `modifying_data.sql`

This file contains SQL queries that involve modifying data in the `cd` schema, such as inserting, updating, and deleting records.

### `data.sql`

This file contains SQL queries to create the schema and insert initial data into the `cd` schema tables.

### `exercises.drawio`

This file contains the database diagram in draw.io format.

### `exercises.md`

This file contains markdown documentation for the exercises.

## Usage

To run the SQL queries, you can use any SQL client that supports PostgreSQL. Simply copy and paste the queries into your
SQL client and execute them against the appropriate database.

## Requirements

- PostgreSQL Database
- cd Schema
- Tables: facilities, members, bookings

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates various SQL querying techniques, including basic data retrieval, filtering, joining tables,
and using conditional logic. The provided queries can be used as a reference for similar database operations.

## To Do

- [ ] Add more SQL queries
